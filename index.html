                            Whether you’re an investor looking to develop a piece of commercial property, or you’re a business, a school or non-
                            profit organization in need of a new facility, taking on a construction project is one of the most exhausting and
                            daunting tasks you will ever do in your lifetime, even if you hire all the right people.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Commercial construction & development can be a very risky and very expensive venture.  The stakes are high and there
                            can be a lot of unknowns, unknowns that can be costly enough to cause complete project failure.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            If you don’t do commercial development and building for a living, what kind of advice are you likely to receive if you
                            decide you’d like to build?
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            First, go hire an owner’s representative.  He’ll keep an eye on your architect and general contractor and make sure your
                            interests are upheld.  Next, go get a good architect.  But make sure and get several proposals from different architects so
                            you can be sure you’re not paying too much for the one you decide to go with.  Next, let your owner’s representative and
                            architect help you choose a good general contractor.  But again, make sure you get several proposals so you can make sure
                            you’re not paying too much.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>There are a few issues with this approach:</strong>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            You get what you pay for.  Nothing could be truer of design and construction.  If something’s too good to be true…  it
                            most likely is.  By competitively bidding your architect and your general contractor you’re giving them every incentive to
                            exclude everything possible from their scopes of work so they can be the low number and get awarded the job.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            By using the current approach you increase your own exposure to risk.  An owner will end up hiring an architect and a
                            general contractor who are going to avoid responsibilities at every turn and make every effort to recoup losses or low fees
                            by the end of the project.
                        </p>

                            When working with ADS there are no hidden margins or markups on subcontractors, labor, material or
                            equipment.  As a Class A licensed Contractor ADS receives large discounts on large equipment rental rates and
                            Commercial Contractor discounts on material.  We pass these savings on to the project in contrast to billing the
                            project with “retail” or “rack” rates for the equipment, "market" bill rates for labor, or "handling" fees & markups
                            on material.  Field labor is treated the same.  There is also no General Contractor stated markup, fee or overhead
                            on any of the work we supervise.  You will recieve all direct costs to the project at just that....  direct cost.... no
                            mark ups.

                        <p>
                            One of the biggest issues in the current construction market is the number of entities your project will pass
                            through.  Lack of management continuity from start to finish increases risk to you as an owner.  At ADS we will
                            be fully engaged with your project from inception through completion.  No handoffs.

                            utmost integrity.  Someone once said “Honesty is what you do in the dark when no one else is watching”.  ADS
                            never has look over its shoulder.  Let us be your partner in trust and excellence.
